Here one can find the R-code used within the context of the thesis 'Bayesian joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data: Implementation using INLA and its application in cardiovascular event modeling.'

* Simulation: the code within this direction is used for Chapter 6, which designs several simulation scenarios to demonstrate the performance of Bayesian joint models built by the INLA package. [run_simulation.R](https://github.com/lct19/MSc-Thesis/blob/main/Simulation/run_simulation.R) can be used to execute the simulations in the same direction. Other simulation scenarios can be found in [History](https://github.com/lct19/MSc-Thesis/tree/main/History)
* Application: the code within this direction is used for Chapter 7, which aims to model the association between longitudinal biomarkers and risk of reoperation or death. The dataset is not included for privacy reasons.
* History: some recordings during the project. For instance, the [README](https://github.com/lct19/MSc-Thesis/blob/main/History/README.md) file in this direction records the weekly meetings during the MSc Thesis project.
